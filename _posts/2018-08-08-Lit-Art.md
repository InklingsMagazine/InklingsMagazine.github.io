<h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"> An analysis of light and dark in art that's truly lit <i class="em em-bulb"></i> </h4>

Light, and the absence of light, is literally everywhere. We wake up accustomed to sun rays filtering through our windows and sleep in response to nightfall. Light provides energy for our biosphere, powers our oxygen sources, and allows us to see the shapes and colors of matter around us. The study of light is the in the interest of biologists, physicists, architects, solar scientists, writers, astronomers...the list is endless. Obviously, human perception of light is broad, and its effects on us are even greater. Human civilization is completely dependent on light for sustenance. So it’s not a surprise that artists of all kinds use light and its counterpart, darkness, to inspire, move, and convey new ideas.

The American artist James Turrell very accurately claimed, “Art history is littered with works that involve light.” Art historians have analyzed techniques which take advantage of light as a device to evoke emotions and create appropriate atmospheres for their work. Renaissance artists such as Leonardo da Vinci loved making use of sfumato, a technique which allows tones and colors to shade gradually into one another, producing softened outlines or hazy forms, something we can see easily in the Mona Lisa. Later, works in the 17th and 18th century Rococo period used a similar technique to soften pastel tones and heighten drama through subtle contrasts in light and shade, which emphasized the idyllic, fantasy nature of scenes such as the one pictured below.

There are plenty more examples of light and dark being used in the timeline of art masterpieces, from Caravaggio's Baroque renditions of grotesque Biblical scenes to Monet’s Impressionist portrayals of water at different times of the day. However, a textbook or museum display will only take you so far—most of us aren’t used to putting on our analysis lenses and looking for these techniques when we’re not told to. Below you’ll find art pieces side by side—the ones on the left from an artist you’ve seen everywhere, and those on the right from names you have likely never heard before—unless of course, you have undertaken the noble pursuit of studying art history (in which case you deserve a large round of applause!). All of these pieces use light and dark as an important medium to achieve a desired effect—challenge your mind to spot the artists’ approaches, and you’ll find yourself becoming something of an art expert yourself!
