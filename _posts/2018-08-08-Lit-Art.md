<h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"> An analysis of light and dark in art that's truly lit <i class="em em-bulb"></i> </h4>

Light, and the absence of light, is literally everywhere. We wake up accustomed to sun rays filtering through our windows and sleep in response to nightfall. Light provides energy for our biosphere, powers our oxygen sources, and allows us to see the shapes and colors of matter around us. The study of light is the in the interest of biologists, physicists, architects, solar scientists, writers, astronomers…the list is endless. Obviously, human perception of light is broad, and its effects on us are even greater. Human civilization is completely dependent on light for sustenance. So it’s not a surprise that artists of all kinds use light and its counterpart, darkness, to inspire, move, and convey new ideas.

> "Art history is littered with works that involve light."
> \- James Turrell

There are many examples of light and dark being used in the timeline of art masterpieces, from Caravaggio’s Baroque renditions of grotesque Biblical scenes to Monet’s Impressionist portrayals of water at different times of the day. However, a textbook or museum display will only take you so far—most of us aren’t used to putting on our analytical lenses and looking for these techniques when we’re not told to. Below you’ll find art pieces side by side—the ones on the left from an artist you’ve seen everywhere, and those on the right from names you have likely never heard before—unless of course, you have undertaken the noble pursuit of studying art history. All of these pieces use light and dark as an important medium to achieve a desired effect—challenge your mind to spot the artists’ approaches, and you’ll find yourself becoming something of an art expert yourself!

***Tanner - The Two Disciples at the Tomb (1906).***

In The Calling of St. Matthew, Carvaggio uses the traditional techniques of Baroque art, a dark background, in contrast with a ray of light eminating from behind Christ. This light lands on Levi, his chosen disciple, and casts holy, cleansing light on Levi's habitat of greed as a tax collector. Light is used similarly in the work of the first accliamed African-American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner. In depicting the scene of Christ's disciples finding his tomb empty, Tanner uses two sources of light: a natural light eminating from inside the tomb and a supernatural illumination of John himself. This illumination signifies John's faith in contrast to the dark earthy tones of Peter, who denied Christ.

***Sergey P. Tkachev and Alexey P. Tkachev - The Children (1962).***

 Starry Night has long been acclaimed for it's beautiful depiction of rolling, twinkling stars. We've seen it everywhere! A similar impressionist treatment of light is visible in The Children, in which textured strokes evoke an image of the summer sunlight sparkling on a rippling lake. Both Van Gogh and the Tkachev brothers, who were part of Russia's Realism movement, manage to create the illusion of fluttering light through their illustrative brushwork.

Great use of light isn't limited to a few stuffy artists from long ago. We received submissions of some brilliant artworks for Inklings Magazine this past year. Of these, two paintings caught our eyes for rivaling the illuminating techniques of the great masters we've shown you today.

***Joy Zou - Untitled (2018).***

***Michelle Bui - Untitled (2018).***
{: style="text-align: right"}

Both these works are incredible in the way they make use of negative space to convey, light, shadows, and depth. Michelle's work is reminiscent of pointillist artists like George Seurat, however she masters the technique known as stippling, to clearly portray the scene at sunrise.
Joy uses light strategically to convey a post modernist mentality, with the claustrophobia of the modern commercial world being represented in darker colors, while light focuses inward on the personal subject of a man. The man's purchased garments are all dark black, while only the man himself and the paper he is reading, containing personal stories of others likely, is shown in light, suggesting a need to return to the personal and human in our modern world.

Evidently, art doesn't have to come from a fancy museum or be lauded by art critics for it to be great. Amazing work can come from within your community itself! If you want to see more work like this, from your own peers in San Diego, please share our details with your artistic or well-written (we do writing submissions too!) friends, and submit something to our magazine yourself by emailing <wvinklingsmag@gmail.com> with your art or writing submission.
