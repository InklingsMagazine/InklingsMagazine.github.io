<h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"> An analysis of light and dark in art that's truly lit <i class="em em-bulb"></i> </h4>

Light, and the absence of light, is literally everywhere. We wake up accustomed to sun rays filtering through our windows and sleep in response to nightfall. Light provides energy for our biosphere, powers our oxygen sources, and allows us to see the shapes and colors of matter around us. The study of light is the in the interest of biologists, physicists, architects, solar scientists, writers, astronomers…the list is endless. Obviously, human perception of light is broad, and its effects on us are even greater. Human civilization is completely dependent on light for sustenance. So it’s not a surprise that artists of all kinds use light and its counterpart, darkness, to inspire, move, and convey new ideas.

> "Art history is littered with works that involve light."
> \- James Turrell

There are many examples of light and dark as devices used in the timeline of art masterpieces, from Caravaggio’s Baroque renditions of grotesque Biblical scenes to Monet’s Impressionist portrayals of water at different times of the day. However, a textbook or museum display will only take you so far—most of us aren’t used to putting on our analytical lenses and looking for these techniques when we’re not told to. Below you’ll find art pieces side by side: the ones on the left from an artist you’ve seen everywhere, and those on the right from names you have likely never heard before—unless of course, you have undertaken the noble pursuit of studying art history. All of these pieces contain light and dark as an important medium to achieve a desired effect. Challenge your mind to spot the artists’ approaches, and you’ll find yourself becoming something of an art expert yourself!

***Tanner - The Two Disciples at the Tomb (1906).***

In The Calling of St. Matthew, Caravaggio uses traditional techniques of Baroque art like chiaroscuro, exemplified in his contrast of a dark background with a ray of light emanating from behind Christ. This light lands on Levi, his chosen disciple, and casts holy, cleansing light on Levi’s habitat of greed as a tax collector. Light is used similarly in the work of the first recognized African-American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner. In depicting the scene of Christ’s disciples finding his tomb empty, Tanner uses two sources of light: a natural light emanating from inside the tomb and a supernatural illumination of John himself. This illumination signifies John’s faith in contrast to the dark earthy tones of Peter, who denied Christ. Through this simple distinction, Tanner skillfully characterizes the two opposing personas and the conflicting themes they represent.

***Sergey P. Tkachev and Alexey P. Tkachev - The Children (1962).***

Starry Night has long been acclaimed for its beautiful depiction of rolling, twinkling stars. We’ve seen it everywhere! A similar impressionist treatment of light is visible in The Children, in which textured strokes evoke an image of the summer sunlight sparkling on a rippling lake. Both Van Gogh, a member of the post impressionist movement, and the Tkachev brothers, part of Russia's Realism movement, manage to create an illusion of fluttering light through their illustrative brushwork.

Great use of light isn’t limited to a few stuffy artists from long ago. We received submissions of some brilliant artworks for Inklings Magazine this past year. Of these, two paintings caught our eyes for rivaling the illuminating techniques of the great masters we’ve shown you today.

***Joy Zou - Feeling (2018).***
{: style="text-align: right"}

Both these works are incredible in the way they make use of negative space to convey light, shadows, and depth. *Feeling* manages to perfectly depict a feminine figure using only varying shades of light and dark. Her masterful use of newspaper clippings in the background furthers the message that we are often overwhelmed by feelings with the proliferation of negative news media in the modern world. *Cafe Curb* uses light strategically to convey a post-modernist mentality, with the claustrophobia of the modern commercial world being represented in darker colors, while light focuses inward on the personal subject of a man. The man’s purchased garments are all dark black, while only the man himself and the paper he is reading, likely containing personal stories of others, are shown in light. This contrast of light and dark suggests a need to return the personal and human in our modern world.

Evidently, art doesn’t have to come from a fancy museum or be lauded by art critics for it to be appreciable. Amazing work can come from within your community itself!
