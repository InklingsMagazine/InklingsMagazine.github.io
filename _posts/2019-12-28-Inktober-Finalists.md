Armed with weekly (often home-baked) sugar indulgences, our staff had an immense amount of fun perusing Inktober submissions last month! We think everyone who submitted is a **superbly awesome** person, and we wanted to learn more about their artistic and literary sides. Here are a few snippets into the creative lives and minds of four Inktober finalists who scored in the top 20% of all submissions through our blind review process. Let's meet them!

> **Reflections** <br>
> Thirsty clouds swallow sunbeams, <br>
> And the window glistens with condensation; <br>
> If only my hands could drift away onto piano keys, <br>
> To play the way out of sweet condemnation; <br>
> 
> Stars drift by and make streaks of light; <br>
> The morning induces faint perplexion; <br>
> I can almost trickle into the foggy mirror, <br>
> Which stares back with my reflection. <br>
> 
> If I gaze closely enough I can make out another person, <br>
> Who cheers me up before I worsen. <br>
> Once again the weight sublimely climbs up my spine, <br>
> And the racing thoughts tightly intertwine <br>
> 
> Into strings which puppet me into the future <br>
> And into the lines which keep my wounds sutured; <br>
> They’ll paint me every color just for fun; <br>
> Every color except my favorite one. <br>
> 
> I’ll give it all away to anyone, <br>
> But please return to sender; <br>
> The steepest price for peace of mind, <br>
> I’ll always be a higher spender. <br>
> 
> A war is waging inside us all, <br>
> With bayonets of good and evil; <br>
> The side that wins is the one we feed, <br>
> The other dormant for retrieval; <br>
> 
> We’ve lived and died inside our minds, <br>
> A thousand times to become kind; <br>
> Before we felt alive and sighed, <br>
> The purple bled into the orange sky. <br>
> 
> I’ll hold your hand, don’t feel alone; <br>
> I love you so I’ll let it go. <br>
> 
> Because deep inside I’ll always know, <br>
> If you care you’ll come back slow; <br>
> And stir the galaxies in my eyes, <br>
> While I’m stunned and still surprised. <br>
> 
> I wish I could see your face again <br>
> But no matter how many times the water dries away, <br>
> No matter where it splashes or where it sprays <br>
> My dearest friend, <br>
> 
> I’ll hold your hand, don’t feel alone; <br>
> I love you so I’ll let it go. <br>
> 
> I loved you so I let you go.

**Three words to describe yourself:** 

> Ecstatic, determined, observant 
>
> Robert H. '21

> The Mom Friend<sup>TM</sup>[^XD]
>
> [^XD]:XD.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> kachow, zooweemama, Ilovewestviewinklings[^love]
>
> [^love]: we love you too!
>
> Philip C. ‘20

**Favorite quote/life motto:**

> "In the ninja world, those who don’t follow the rules are trash. But, those who abandon their friends are even worse than trash." 
>
> Philip C. '20

> “In the end, we only regret the chances we didn’t take.” 
>
> Tina K. '22	

> “I am my only rival” - two-time Olympic figure-skating champion Yuzuru Hanyu[^woah]
>
> [^woah]: woah this is cool!
>
> Amy W. '19

> “Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don’t wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don’t wish for less challenge, wish for more wisdom.” - Jim Rohn
>
> Robert H. '21

**Favorite Westview art/writing teacher and why:** 

> My favorite Westview art teacher is Mrs. Jeri Webb because she is *the* G. [^G]
>
> [^G]: the G” loosely translates to "possessor of god-like qualities." also, Mrs. Webb is not with Gold anymore, but we all miss her very much!
>
> Philip C. '20

> Mrs. Layne is such an amazing teacher. She has not only advanced my photography skills, but she has also taught me very important life lessons.
>
> Tina K. '22	

> Mr. Opstad! He showed us a variety of mediums that I had never worked with before (gouache, scratchboard, and oil pastel, just to name a few) and provided constructive criticism for all of our pieces. The most helpful aspect of his class were the in-class critiques, in which we individually showed our pieces to our classes to receive comments and suggestions; it taught us how to accept compliments and criticism and also how to give both.
> 
> Amy W. '19	

**Favorite person (other than yourself ;)) and why:**

> My favorite person is Sauharda Chowdhuri.[^ngl]
>
> [^ngl]: Not going to lie, we weren’t expecting this one. We don’t disagree, though! All of our staff loves each other :)
>
> Philip C. ‘20

> My best friend—I’ve known her since kindergarten and she is an endless source of
> inspiration, motivation, and support. I’m forever grateful to have her in my life.[^wholesome]
>
> [^wholesome]: ahh this is wholesome <3
>
> Amy W. ‘19

**Favorite piece of art/literature and why:**

> Van Gogh’s Sunflowers are my favorite series of paintings. I researched them in depth
> for my Sophomore Thesis and gained insight into his techniques as well his history and
> life—it honestly might have been the catalyst for my interest in psychology.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> “Invictus” by William Ernest Henley really resonates with me because I feel a good amount of the environments we find ourselves in are quick to provide challenges that test our attitude and determination, and a lot of times giving up or becoming passive is a much easier option. Although this is true, the possibility of becoming stronger evades those who choose not to face their problems and “Invictus” speaks volumes in igniting the will to take control of life and determine our own fate and lot in it.[^cool]
>
> [^cool]:thanks for the recommendation!
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> My favourite piece of literature ever is *Boy's Club* by Matt Furie because it is one of the most influential pieces of literature of the modern era. [^sure]
>
> [^sure]: *sure* it is Philip
>
> Philip C. ‘20

**Tell us about your creative background. Have you participated in any programs/classes**
**that sparked your interest in art and/or writing, or is this just a casual hobby?**

> My love for photography started out as a hobby, but I really started getting serious about it after I took Photography 1-2 at Westview last year.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

> I took art classes outside of school for 11 years and completed Drawing & Painting 1-2 up
> to AP Studio Art at Westview High School. I’m not currently taking any art classes in
> university, but I still draw quite consistently in my free time.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> I used to go to art class in middle school but then I realized I didn't want to be a beta[^beta]. Now, I only draw as a casual hobby.
>
> [^beta]: going off of *Brave New World*, let’s assume this means a class of being inferior to Alphas, the dominant players in society.
>
> Philip C. ‘20

>  I’ve been writing since the age of 10 years old to entertain my friends, whether it is stories of space fighter pilots fighting off alien invaders or the newly found fondness of poetry which I started dabbling in 3 years ago. I was published by Rancho Bernardo Highschool’s Friends of the Library in 2018 in their 2018 Poetry Showcase as a part of their annual poetry contest, and I’ve been working on two books and participating in the Wallflower Poetry Club[^club] and writing ever since. 
>
> [^club]: we love wallflower poetry! they meet on thursdays at lunch in wenger (L104) and you should totally drop by and meet them! (inklings meets on tuesdays at lunch in wenger! come meet us too, we love new people <3)
>
> Robert H. ‘21

**How has your work evolved over time?**

> Over the course of the last 3 years, I’ve spent countless hours exploring character analysis videos and guides on how to write interesting dialogues and characters. Compared to a few years ago poetry and writing has become rather exciting and has progressed past the ideological vent it started from into an enticing story or a beautiful description that I use to try and make others envision and explore for themselves, because without an entertained or inspired audience what use is poetry or writing?[^use]
>
> [^use]: we know this was a rhetorical question, but we just wanted to say, “it’s no use at all!”
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> Just about a year and a half ago, I really had no idea how to work a camera and what each button meant. But when I took photography my Freshman year, I started to understand the techniques and how to “shoot the perfect shot”.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

> I started off with the very typical “anime”-style drawings that art teachers claim to
> despise, before transferring to an almost hyper-realistic style. I am now working to
> loosen up my style again; instead of recreating photographs, I want to reinterpret my
> references to show the audience what I want them to see rather than what they might
> actually see.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

***What* inspires you to create?**

> Colors. As cheesy as that might be, I feel like colors have always been my muse.
> Especially after my art teachers all taught me to use pure black as scarcely as possible, I
> found myself using as many colors as I could to create the shadows in my pieces. I feel like colors never cease to motivate me to create because they involve more than just
> art—there’s science behind colors, wavelengths and the way we process them through
> biology, chemistry, and physics. There’s an infinite number of possibilities that they
> offer, so I love to use as many colors as I can in all the pieces I make.[^beautiful]
>
> [^beautiful]:wow, this is deep. we stan :)
>
> Amy W. ‘19

>  It’s really just a voice inside of me that begs me to take out my camera.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

> I really like the smiles and laughter from the audience, and love the silence of thought when poetry or stories get serious because it lets me know others are exploring their own questions and ideals and enjoying something thought-provoking, and that’s something you can’t buy with money![^indeed]
>
> [^indeed]: indeed!
>
> Robert H. ‘21

***Who* inspires you to create?**

> All my teachers, friends, and classmates.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

> The person that inspires me to create is Gekyume Onfroy[^who is this].
>
> [^who is this]: so I didn’t know who this was. apparently he’s the son of a murdered rapper, XXXTentacion, and his ex-partner, Jenesis Sanchez. we wish gekyume the very best in his journey in this sometimes harsh, but overall lovely universe <3
>
> Philip C. ‘20

> Lately, I’ve been indulging in the work of H.P. Lovecraft with the strong descriptive narratives and the absolutely insane stories and tales! The way he can describe a town is absolutely awe-inspiring and they are really interesting reads. My favorite so far is *The Thing on the Doorstep* but I haven’t read *The Call of Cthulu* yet, it’s still new to me but it’s very inspiring and creative from what I’ve read so far.
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> I suppose this depends. I usually just like creating for myself, but there’s so many
> brilliant artists that are on my social media feeds that I admire, so I suppose I want to
> embody their techniques as well. I also have a tendency to hyperfixate on certain subjects
> depending on the media I’m consuming (mostly TV shows like Doctor Who, Sherlock,
> Good Omens... the list never ends), so I’ll be constantly inspired to create by the themes
> of those stories and those amazing portrayals as well.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

**What is your creative process like (e.g., working in chunks or spurts of inspiration)?**

> I used to be better at separating my pieces into chunks to finish over quite some time,
> but since I’m much busier in university, I usually just sit myself down and finish
> whatever inspiration has been eating away at me in one time frame. I’m usually struck by
> inspiration right when my academics become busiest, so I have to ignore the urge to
> create for quite a while before finally succumbing to it.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> I always plan out what and how I want to shoot a couple of days before. When I have it all laid out, I start shooting, but once I feel like I have no inspiration left I stop and wait till the next day. Sometimes it’s a long process, other times I find the perfect picture in half an hour, it all really depends.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

> I’ve started carrying around a journal for random doodling and writing, and every once in a while an idea or thought comes to mind and finds its way into the journal. Sooner or later it gets written in on the computer and becomes a poem or a story idea! 
>
> Robert H. ‘21

**What’s your favorite medium/genre and why?**

> Dystopian/Utopian fiction, and science fiction because they often explore ideas without the limitation of certain points of realism yet they seem as real as the world we live in. 
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> My favorite medium is still without a doubt colored pencils. Although I don’t use it as
> much due to its incredibly time-consuming nature, it’s still my favorite because it can be
> paired with other mediums and it’s fantastic for doing detailed work in particular. I’ve
> recently been working mainly in graphite sketch, watercolors, and pens (and I might pick
> up charcoal again), because they’re fast and convenient.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

**In your opinion, what’s your biggest flaw as an artist/writer? Do you embrace this, or is it**
**something you’re working on improving?**

> My biggest flaw as a person in general honestly is just that I tend to be perfectionist. It’s
> good as part of my work ethic because I always take academics very seriously, but it also
> becomes debilitating when I’m stuck on the same detail of a piece or sentence in my
> writing just because I can’t make it absolutely perfect. I’m working on finding a better
> balance to putting in my best effort into my creations while also forgiving myself and
> moving on if it’s not precisely what I intended.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> I feel as if I don’t get enough written down as I want to, and sometimes I find what I write to be lacking and that stops me from writing further or even attending writing events. I know that if someone wants to be great at something they must be willing to be bad, as everyone initially starts off poor in any skill or talent, but knowing that sometimes isn’t enough to get my pen to paper or my fingers to the keyboard. I’m working on it though, and I won’t stop until it’s done.
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> My biggest flaw is that it is hard for me to create art that others appreciate but I embrace this because I believe that they are all normies.
>
> Philip C. ‘20

> Not believing in myself is a big one. I’m trying to work on it, but it’s taking some time.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

**Is there an overarching vision or style you often find yourself portraying in your work?**

> It really just varies; sometimes my pictures are dark and mysterious, and other times they’re happy and bright.
>
> Tina K. ‘22

>  I’d like my work to bring things about ourselves to the surface to be appreciated or dealt with, like overcoming the hardships of true self-acceptance or finding/forging a better place or better relationships which allow one to improve. If I can help anyone on that path, then the work I have put out will be truly satisfying and earned its purpose.
>
> Robert H. ‘21

> I’m still not really sure I’ve found a personal “style” yet, though my friends often claim
> they can tell when I’ve painted something. Since I mostly draw portraits, I give extra
> attention to the eyes and hands of a person, since I feel like they can often be the most
> expressive aspects of an individual. They can be the hardest to draw oftentimes, but
> ultimately, they’re my favorite part to capture in my works.
>
> Amy W. ‘19

> The overarching vision in my art style is pepe.[^pepe]
>
> Philip C. ‘20

[^pepe]: Pepe the frog really is Philip's dominant style. This green anthromorphic frog with a humanoid body became an Internet meme after Matt Furie included the figure in his Boy's Club comic.
